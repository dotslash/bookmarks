bookmarks
=========

The code for [bm.yesteapea.com](http://bm.yesteapea.com). I use the site to bookmark websites with custom redirect URLs. The website is written completely in PHP. What makes this more usable to me is this library called [editable grid](https://github.com/webismymind/editablegrid).

*Note* : Even though the website is publicly accessible, content can be modified only be me (One has to enter the secret key to edit content).
