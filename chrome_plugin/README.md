This is simple chrome extension I use to bookmark urls and give a custom handle, 
E.g [suram.in/r/latency-numbers](http://suram.in/r/latency-numbers) will redirect to [https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832)

This adds a popup next to the address bar, which on clicking lets the user (me) add custom handles to current tab url.
If there are any some handles to current tab url, the extension shows them all. See the below examples

Check the screenshots to see how the extention looks when
- Wrong secret entered when adding a handle
- A handle is successfully added
- There are already 2 custom handles
